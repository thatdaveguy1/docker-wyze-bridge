# What's Changed

## What's Changed in v4.2.2

Patch release focused on MQTT motion correctness and deterministic expiry behavior.

### Major Changes

- Fix the BOA/LAN MQTT motion path so publishes land on `wyzebridge/<camera>/motion` instead of the wrong double-prefixed topic.
- Normalize BOA/LAN motion payloads to `1` and `2` so Home Assistant and Scrypted helpers see the same contract as the API motion path.
- Use bridge receipt time for event-driven motion latching instead of the original event timestamp.
- Force motion expiry checks through the stream monitor loop so `motion=2` is published deterministically.
- Add focused regression coverage for topic shape, payload shape, receipt-time latching, and expiry behavior.

## What's Changed in v4.2.1

Patch release focused on Home Assistant defaults, Frigate compatibility, and release-surface cleanup.

### Major Changes

- Fix Home Assistant per-camera feed defaults so explicit `CAM_OPTIONS` `HD` and `SD` values apply at runtime even when `/config/wyze_camera_settings.json` is absent.
- Add focused regression coverage for that precedence rule and validate it live in the dev add-on without a saved runtime settings file.
- Record the production-safe outcome: production restored with the intended `SD`-only camera defaults after validation.
- Fix the bundled Home Assistant native `go2rtc` sidecar so it no longer keeps the upstream default WebRTC listener on `:8555`, which blocked Frigate startup on shared hosts.
- Normalize preserved `/config/go2rtc_wyze.yaml` listener blocks on startup so stale `api`, `rtsp`, or `webrtc` settings cannot keep the old `:8555` bind alive across rebuilds.
- Add packaging regression coverage to ensure the generated sidecar config keeps overriding that default listener in all three runtime trees.

## What's Changed in v4.1.1

Patch release focused on the shared native `go2rtc` runtime path and clearer native camera behavior.

### Major Changes

- Move native `go2rtc` startup into a shared helper so root Docker, the production add-on, and the local dev add-on all bootstrap the same sidecar flow.
- Add camera-level native selection metadata, native snapshot routing, and richer `/health/details` diagnostics so `HL_CAM4` can prefer native while `HL_BC` stays bridge-first.
- Add API-first native talkback through `POST /api/<camera>/talkback` for cameras already validated on the native sidecar path.

## What's Changed in v4.2.0

Release focused on runtime-tree alignment, granular feed publishing controls, and release-surface cleanup.

### Major Changes

- Normalize the shared Web UI runtime across the root app, production add-on, and local dev add-on while preserving the intentional dev-only `:55000` loopback talkback port.
- Carry the merged per-camera feed configuration work across the runtime trees, including `HD` and `SD` enablement, per-feed kbps targets, and surfaced feed metadata in the Web UI.
- Keep the public add-on and docs aligned around the supported native `go2rtc` RTSP surface on `:19554`, with `:11984` still treated as internal-only.
- Bump release and packaging surfaces to `4.2.0` and the dev add-on surfaces to `4.2.0-dev`.

## What's Changed in v4.0.2

Patch release focused on startup hardening and Home Assistant runtime validation.

### Major Changes

- Gate WHEP downstream output tracks on real upstream media readiness instead of local track allocation alone.
- Prevent bridge startup crashes when Wyze login succeeds but `get_user_info` fails or returns empty by falling back to the configured email for local auth/bootstrap needs.
- Add regression coverage for the fallback-user path and keep add-on release metadata aligned for the `4.0.2` patch line.
- Carry forward the minimal Home Assistant prod/dev swap workflow and in-app diagnostics approach used during live validation.

## What's Changed in v4.0.1

Patch release focused on Home Assistant packaging and documentation clarity.

### Major Changes

- Surface the standard Home Assistant login fields (`Wyze email`, `Wyze password`, `Key ID`, `API key`) by default in the add-on manifest.
- Mirror the same visible-login behavior in the repository-local dev add-on manifest and add packaging coverage for it.
- Update HA translations and docs so the standard login path no longer describes the API credentials as optional for normal setup.
- Clarify HA sub-stream wording so it reflects the internal capability map and explicitly notes that Pan V2 is not currently included.
- Validate the current KVS startup and playback behavior in the HA dev lane without changing runtime behavior, since the reported `400` warning was not reproduced in this patch cycle.

## What's Changed in v4.0.0

First public release of the `thatdaveguy1/docker-wyze-bridge` fork. This release focuses on Wyze Cam V4 support, improved Home Assistant integration, and a more stable streaming backend.

### Major Changes

- **Wyze Cam V4 Support:** New cloud-signaled KVS/WebRTC backend for first-class V4 support and improved latency for V3/V3 Pro cameras.
- **Home Assistant Optimized:** New `docker_wyze_bridge_v4` slug, ingress-aware base URLs, and conflict-free port mapping (58554, 58888, 58889).
- **Polished Web UI:** One-click copy buttons for stream URLs, improved protocol status reporting, and better stream availability logic.
- **MediaMTX V1.16.3:** Upgraded backend for lower latency, better WebRTC track gathering, and reduced startup failures.
- **Stability Fixes:** Resolved several long-running session, process-cleanup, and on-demand readiness bugs.

## What's Changed in v3.12.3-local

Local patched release built on top of `idisposable/docker-wyze-bridge` `v3.12.3`, with KVS/WebRTC migration ideas likely influenced by `akeslo/docker-wyze-bridge` and a larger set of repo-local reliability, HA integration, and UI work.

### Credit and provenance

- Base fork and release line: `idisposable/docker-wyze-bridge`
- KVS/WebRTC direction for newer cameras, including signaling behavior such as `recipientClientId`: likely influenced by `akeslo/docker-wyze-bridge`
- HA-local packaging, WHEP proxy integration, earlier V4/RTC routing work, deployment tooling, UI changes, regression tests, and operational docs: original local work in this repo
- Detailed attribution was consolidated into this public changelog before release.

### Local changes in this release

- Add a local patched Home Assistant add-on tree under `.ha_live_addon/` with its own Dockerfile, config, runtime, translations, docs, and deployment helpers
- Add a local WHEP proxy path plus KVS config refresh flow for RTC-backed cameras, along with focused routing regression tests
- Fix bridge reliability issues around process cleanup, session lifetime, timeout sizing, and on-demand readiness, with proposed upstream PR notes and targeted tests
- Improve the web UI stream menu, copy actions, protocol availability rules, and loopback auth handling for `/kvs-config/<camera>`
- Add live deployment handoff docs, runbooks, plan docs, task tracking, and sanitized sample payloads used during validation

## What's Changed in v3.12.3

Cleaned up the threading logic around startup/shutdown to reduce CPU and memory leaks

- Added validation checks for the API Key ID and API Key to help prevent issues logging in Fixes #47
- Cleaned up the thread and process tracking to ensure that we release threads when they're done
- Only allow one running purge thread per camera Fixes #40
- Added timeouts to all the thread `.join()`s to ensure we don't hang waiting for threads to die off
- Increased the buffer site for the pipe reads to reduce CPU load
- Consistently swallow ValueError, AttributeError, RuntimeError, and FileNotFound errors so sub-processes and threads terminate correctly

Note: v3.12.2 was everything above, but missing the change notes, oops.

# What's Changed in v3.12.1

Cleaned MQTT logic and pull in some others' changes

### New features

Automatic Sunrise/Sunset snapshots drive ny the `LONGITUDE` and `LATITUDE` configuration variables.

# What's Changed in v3.12.0

Cleaned up the startup logic to ensure things start quickly and moved configurations around so everything is overrideable

- Moved API-driven snapshots into the `Stream_Manager.py` so they don't delay startup.
- Clean up the /var/log directory in Dockerfile build image
- Better to supply empty, not samples in config
- Switch to `run` for diagnostic dump
- Deprecate the `config.yml` setting of environment variables so we can set the `IMG_DIR` and `RECORD_PATH` reliably even
  if not running inside Home Assistant as an add-on
- Remove the MTX_* variables from the `.env` as we want them to be settable in the options.
- Explicitly default the MTX settings that used to be forced (MTX_READTIMEOUT=30s, MTX_HLSVARIANT=mpegts, MTX_WRITEQUEUESIZE=2048) 
  to ensure backward compatibility
- Updated the defaults for the `IMG_DIR` and `RECORD_PATH` to match what the `.env` would have 
  previously set, but now it's overridable.
- Reduced log spam by making some `.info(` calls `.debug(`
- Don't emit ffmpeg non-error messages  (let the Popen eat them).

## What's Changed in v3.11.1

## What's Changed in v3.10.3

- Bump MediaMTX to 1.12.1

## What's Changed in v3.10.2

- Added code to protect against the aggressive syntax check in MediaMTX 1.12.0 which
  complains about the `recordPath` missing required elements even when recording is
  not enabled (it really shouldn't validate that setting unless one or more paths
  request recording...and didn't through 1.11.3).
  For reference, the pattern is computed from our `RECORD_PATH` and `RECORD_FILE_NAME`
  settings and the combination of them must contain the `strftime` format specifiers
  of *either* a `"%s"` or **all** of of "%Y", "%m", "%d", "%H", "%M", "%S" (case-sensitive).
  If the value is not compliant, to keep MediaMTX from erroring out, we append `"_%s"` whatever
  was specified and emit a warning.
- Changed the default `RECORD_PATH` to ~`"record/%path/%Y/%m/%d/"`~ *v3.10.7* `"%path/{cam_name}/%Y/%m/%d"`
- Changed the default `RECORD_FILE_NAME` to `"%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M-%S"`

## What's Changed in v3.10.1

- Add `TOTP_KEY` and `MQTT_DTOPIC` to *config.yml* schema to avoid logged warning noise
- Add `MQTT_DTOPIC` to *config.yml* options to ensure a usable default
- Add `video: true` to all the *config.yml* variants to ensure hardware encoding can
  use video card
- Upgrade to `python:3.13-slim-bookworm` for docker base image
- Cleaned up Dockerfile scripts for testing and multiarch
- Safer docker build by testing the tarballs downloaded for MediaMTX or FFMpeg

## What's Changed in v3.10.0

- Attempt upgrade of MediaMTX to 1.12.0 (again)
- Fixed schema of RECORD_LENGTH config option (it needs an `s` or `h` suffix, so must be string)
- Added RECORD_KEEP to the config.yml so it can be actually be configured in the add-on

## What's Changed in v3.0.7

- Better logging of exceptions and pass the MediaMTX messages through to main logs
- Correct building of permissions for MediaMTX
- Documented all the possible points in the docker-compose files.

## What's Changed in v3.0.6
